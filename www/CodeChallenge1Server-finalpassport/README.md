### Contributing

We welcome everyone to contribute to our projects and help us tackle existing issues! To do so, there are a few things you need to know about the code. First, our code is divided in an MVC like structure, all available inside the app folder:

`app/models - Contains all our application and business logic`

`app/controllers - Contains everything that happens when requests come in and get dispatched`

This application is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!
